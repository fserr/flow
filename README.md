# Flow2

A minimal Pomodoro timer for macOS.

This is a clone of [Flow](https://flowapp.info), the Pomodoro app. I wanted something similar with minimal features and the customization options without paying for a subscription plan. The entire app was written by Claude Code (Opus 4.5) - I just described what I wanted.

## Features

- Menu bar timer (left-click: show window, right-click: start/pause)
- Work sessions, short breaks, long breaks
- Configurable durations

## Install

Xcode is required.

```bash
open Flow2.xcodeproj
# Press Cmd+R to build and run
# Or build Release and copy Flow2.app to /Applications
```
