# Flow2

A minimal Pomodoro timer for macOS.

This is a clone of [Flow](https://flowapp.info), the Pomodoro app. I wanted something similar, so I built it. The entire thing was written by Claude Code (Opus 4.5) — I just described what I wanted.

## Features

- Menu bar timer (left-click: show window, right-click: start/pause)
- Always-on-top floating window
- Work sessions, short breaks, long breaks
- Configurable durations
- Sound on completion

## Install

```bash
open Flow2.xcodeproj
# Press Cmd+R to build and run
# Or build Release and copy Flow2.app to /Applications
```

## Usage

Click play. Work. Take breaks. Repeat.

Press `Cmd+,` for settings.
